# Blawx Implementation

Please note that the public alpha version of Blawx is unstable. It is very possible that this implementation will stop working when
changes are made to the app. If that happens, let @Gauntlet173 on GitHub know.

## Usage

Download the `beard.blawx` file in this folder.
Go to the [Blawx Live Alpha version](https://www.blawx.com/alpha.html), start the app.
Choose "Menu", "Load Workspace" and upload the `beard.blawx` file.

Then choose "Menu", and "Run Blawx Code" to run the query to determine if the tests passed.

## Details

The Blawx implementation uses actual lengths for the beard instead of a true/false variable
indicating whether the length is 5mm or more.

The test data in the shared folder of the repository has been re-implemented in a data block
inside the Blawx Workspace.

For details, see the blog post at Blawx.com.
