# Blawx Implementation

Please note that the public alpha version of Blawx is unstable. It is very possible that this implementation will stop working when
changes are made to the app. If that happens, let @Gauntlet173 on GitHub know.

# Usage

Download the `beard.blawx` file in this folder.
Go to the [Blawx Live Alpha version](https://www.blawx.com/demo), start the app.
Choose "Menu", "Load Workspace" and upload the `beard.blawx` file.

It should look like this:

In the block that begins "We Know Bob is an Object", change the values to test different scenarios.
Choose "Menu", "Run Blawx Code" to get an answer with the new values.
