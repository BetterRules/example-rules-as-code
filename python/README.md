# Pure Python example of some rules as code

This implements only the Beard Tax Rules.

This should work in python 3. 

You need to run the tests from within the `python` folder for them to run correctly.

Files:

```python
  run.py # Runs some example code, and contains the python class
  test.py # Runs tests the examples in the shared csv file work in our python
```
